**1.What is java?**

* java is an object oriented, platform independent programming language

-Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.

-Learned “Write Once, Run Anywhere” concept via JVM

-Variables are containers for storing data values.

* primitive data types-int, float, double, char, Boolean
* Non-primitive data types -String 

-operators-arithmetic, logical, relational

-println() method to print text in Java

**# input \& output**

-user take input with the Scanner class



Ex, 

&nbsp;  Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

&nbsp;   int number=sc.nextInt()

&nbsp;   String name=sc.nextLine();



**# Conditional statements**

* if, if else, else this is use to control program flow

-if statement needs a condition that results in true or false.

-Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

\- The else statement lets you run a block of code when the condition in the if statement is false



**# Methods**

A method is a block of code



**# Compilation \& Execution**

javac-> use to compile code

java-> use to  run the code



ex, javac Main.java

&nbsp;   java Main
